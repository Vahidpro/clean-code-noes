# Clean Code Notes
### My notes and highlights of the Clean Code book.

# Foreword

> Honesty in small things is not a small thing.

 Attentiveness to detail is an even more critical foundation of professionalism than is any grand vision.
 
 A piece of code should be where you expect to find it—and, if not, you should re-factor to get it there.

**Making your code readable is as important as making it executable.**

> Don’t put off until tomorrow what you can do today.
>
> An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.


 You should name a variable using the same care with which you name a firstborn child.

 **Design as a process, not a static endpoint.**

 # Introduction
  Of course you have been impeded by bad code. So then why did you write it?
 
  We’ve all said we’d go back and clean it up later. Of course, in those days we didn’t know LeBlanc’s law: Later equals never.

  **No duplication, one thing, expressiveness, tiny abstractions. Everything is there.**
  It is not the language that makes programs appear simple. It is the programmer
that make the language appear simple!
